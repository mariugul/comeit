Welcome to the **comeit** project! A linter for conventional commits. Follow the steps below to
install and start using the package.

1. **Install the package**:
   
   You can install **comeit** directly from PyPI using `pip`:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install comeit

2. **Run the application**

  **comeit** includes a CLI tool, you can run it like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

    comeit

  By default, ``comeit`` uses ``git`` internally with ``gitpython`` to read all the commits on the
  current branch. These are the commits that are parsed and reported if nothing else is specified.
   

You're ready to go! Explore the project documentation for further details.
